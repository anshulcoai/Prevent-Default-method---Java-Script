   <p>Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and<br> atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the<br> actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and<br> 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium <br> radioactively decays, usually by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of this <br>decay varies between 159,200 and 4.5 billion years for different isotopes, making them useful for dating the age of the <br>Earth.</p>
